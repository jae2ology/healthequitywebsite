<h1>About the Problem!</h1>
<h3>Health Equity has been an issue since the beginning of integration. Healthcare professionals have preconceived notions and ideals about certain genders, races, or ages, although they shouldnâ€™t. These ideas lead to treating their patients differently and receiving less care. Fighting to protect the equity of all patients will help every patient, not just the ones that are being currently affected.</h3>

<li>Removes discrepancies in treatment.</li>
